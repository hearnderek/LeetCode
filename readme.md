# [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)

Since I do these for fun sometimes I might as well add them to my github.

I started leetcode just to have an excuse to try out github copilot. (Pretty useful, but I dislike when it gives me the answer outright)

# Language Choice

Honestly any language would do. Python just happened to be the easiest language to mess with.

## Other languages to consider
1. C#
2. C++
3. Powershell
4. VBA (since it is widely used in $work projects)
5. Haskell
6. Perl5 (I know, I know)
7. F#
8. Go
9. Javascript
10. Ruby (I just want to monkey patch everything to my hearts content)
